# Stock Exchange Project

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple Stock Exchange system using C++. It primarily serves as learning experience to expose myself to the world of trading whilst enhancing my ability to develop software end-to-end. The system will simulate basic functionalities of a stock exchange, including buying and selling stocks, tracking stock prices, and managing user accounts. In the future, I plan on turning this project into a full-scale application built with a UI and significantly more functionality.
